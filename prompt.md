Instructions:

Output only LaTeX code. Do not include any explanations outside the code.

The summary should be structured for efficient learning and exam preparation: concise yet detailed, covering all essential content.

If a concept in the slides is not well explained, clarify it fully in the summary, using examples if necessary.

Use German for all text.

Do not cite sources.

Include formulas and important transformations in the same chapter if they are not already present.

For graphics referenced in the slides, comment in the code where they would go.

Use the following predefined macros where appropriate:

\begin{defbox}[Header of Defbox] ... \end{defbox}

\defc{this will be printed in red}

Structure content chapter by chapter, and organize definitions, examples, and formulas clearly.

Prioritize clarity, completeness, and exam relevance.
